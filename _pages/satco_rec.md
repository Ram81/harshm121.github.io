## Abstract

Recommendation in the fashion domain has seen a recent surge in research in various areas, for example, shop-the-look, context- aware outfit creation, personalizing outfit creation, etc. Majority of state of the art in the domain of outfit recommendation pursue to improve compatibility among items so as to produce high quality outfits. Some recent works have realized that style is an important factor in fashion and have incorporated it in compatibility learning and outfit generation. These methods often depend on the availability of fine-grained product categories or the presence of rich item attributes (e.g., long-skirt, mini- skirt, etc.). In this work, we aim to generate outfits conditional on styles or themes as one would dress in real life, operating under the practical assumption that each item is mapped to a high level category as driven by the taxonomy of an online portal, like outdoor, formal etc and an image. We use a novel style encoder network that renders outfit styles in a smooth latent space. We present an extensive analysis of different aspects of our method and demonstrate its superiority over existing state of the art baselines through rigorous experiments.

### Sampled Course work

1. In the last semester of my undergraduation, I was fortunate to take a course on [Learning Theory](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/ell880.html) by [Prof. Sumeet Agarwal](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/). As a part of the course, I wrote a term paper on to talk about the Philosophical Motivations of VC Dimension, more specifically, the work of Sir Karl Popper and how it relates to VC Dimension. [This](/PDFs/Learning_Theory.pdf) is the term paper and [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x7bUChOBlgLV3jYDB-SVYzmxDStZtNmn4EXri9mgwIo/edit?usp=sharing) is a presentation on the same topic.  

2. Again, in the last semester of my undergraudation (yes, I did a lot of interesting courses in my last semester), I was lucky to do another very interesting course on [Mind, Machines and Language](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~sumeet/ell457.html). In one of the assignments, we were asked to write our views on one of [Robert Epstein's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Epstein) [article](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer) on Computational Theory of Mind. [Here](/PDFs/Response_The_empty_brain.pdf) are my views on the article. 

3. In one of the assignments of Advanced Machine Learning course by [Prof. Prathosh AP](https://sites.google.com/view/prathosh/home?authuser=0), the task was to classify videos based on their speakers. We (a group of 3 students) solved the task and performed a number of visualisations to understand what is happening under the hood of deep models for classification. [Here](/PDFs/ELL888_Assignment2.pdf) is a technical report of our work.
